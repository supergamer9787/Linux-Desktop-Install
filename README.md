# Linux-Desktop-Install
Set of scripts for every popular Linux Distro that allows a user to install any desktop environment they choose without changing distros or having a headache 

NOTE: You must run these scripts as ROOT using either the root user or as a regular user with sudo
as they need to access your respective Linux distros package manager Ex:(APT, PACMAN, DNF)
Ex: # ./DEinstall-Arch.sh
OR
Ex: sudo ./DEinstall-Arch.sh

These scripts are very much Alpha quality and might not work they were just made by a kid in college
I'm in the process of learning these things please be patient :)

Check the releases for the Scripts :)
